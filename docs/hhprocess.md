Documentation for the user process

### Intro ###
* Splash screen will be the first introduction to the world of Hh
* Before character creation, you have the option to see the full back story
    * Should be accessible in the game as well if you want (Hhelp section)

### Logging In ###
Authenticate the user with some 3rd party provider.
    * Facebook
    * Google
    * 4sq


### Character Creation ###
1. Pick a race
2. Pick a role
3. Pick a name
    * We should have a random name generator that suggests Hhaerth-like names

These three factors determine the initial setting:
* Honey
* Attributes
* Items - Could be picked a little randomly

### Training Ground ###
Right after creating a character, they get a training hreature to kill in one attack.
First check-in is like a teleportation into Hhaerth.
This will allow new characters to get their first HhP and learn how attacking works.

### Checking In (Explore, Call Hreatures, Battle, Summon) ###
* Establish the character location
* Find the hreature, and you get a chance to attack the hreature once for the check-in
    * If the monster dies from the attack, you get Hh and items (possbily)
        * If you are not present when a monster you attacked is killed, then you are notified (by crane/pigeon) and you get your portion of Hh.
    * If the monster does not die:
        * It hits you
        * It gets away somehow... but you can't really attack more than once a day (12 hrs)

### Hrone Battling ###
* Establish the character location
* Hrones are a way to look for items and practice battling


### Views ###
* Inventory - Wearing and Carrying
* Overall Stats - Attributes, Honey
* History - Metrics, notifications
