The Story
---------

###GAME SETTING###
Define: Hh (haitch or haitchum) - the 119th element, exposure to which grants a body increased mental aptitude and physical power.  There is a belief that one who finds peace with Hh may achieve nirvana.

Planet Haerth split from Earth as a parallel reality in the year 4868, when the element Hh was first created by a small team of scientists.  A powerful explosion and surging storm, recorded as the "Haerthcoming", permahashed the planet in its birth, subjecting millions of haerthlings to strong radiation from Hh.  The brains of the haerthlings were pushed beyond genius and into madness, but their bodies grew strong, and they contorted into various monsters known now as the Hreech (informally, hreeches).

However, a few haerthlings remained sheltered from the Haerthcoming, have now regrouped, and continue to roam Haerth with a craving for Hh.  In small doses, they can develop mental prowess and strength without endangering themselves.  As traces of Hh have faded from the environment, haerthlings have learned that the only way to receive Hh is to extract it from hreeches by weakening them, who once emptied will become wandering drones (hrones).

As haerthlings attack the territorial hoarding hreeches for their Hh, other hreeches lurking nearby will observe and rapidly evolve (or absorb hrones) to defend against the demonstrated methods of attack, when they come to take the place of their emptied predecessors.  Greater and cleverer teams of haerthlings must work together to gather the Hh.

### Time ###
Time is measured in hortnights 
Distance is measured in hurlongs
Planet Haerth has a year of 13 hortnights, or 182 Earth days.  In gameplay, the Haerthcoming occurs once every haerthyear and all haerthlings are reset to even the field.

### Haerthtongue ###
Haerthtongue is a derivative of English, a byproduct of the Haerthcoming, when all existing noun dictionaries were exposed to Hh radiation.  While translations have deviations, the general rules to operate (*proper or important) on English nouns are as follows:

If a word begins with a consonant that is not H, the consonant is simply replaced with H

* e.g. carrot = harrot, dragon = hragon, sword = hword

If a word begins with H, an appropriate prefix is prepended to produce a Th

* Prefixes: het-, hat-, hot-, hut-, hit-
* e.g. henry = heth'enry, horse = hoth'orse

If a word begins with Sh, Th, or Ch, a prefix is prepended, or the leading consonant is removed:

* Prefixes: Hesh, Hoth, Hach
* e.g. shoe = heshoe, chain = hachain, thomas = homas

If a word begins with a vowel, H is prepended:

* e.g., apple = happle, ocean = hocean

in context: haerthling species, game objects, game vernacular, not applied to geo-locations or check-in locations

### Names ###
* At the time of character generation, a haerthname may be chosen (random H-name generator)
* Username is not in haerthtongue (users may have several characters)
* Example names: Herot, Hython, Hwrl, Hnoom, Hrchys, Hedel, Heciel, Helemne, Habried, Hemmone, Hait, Hati
* The Hreech do not have names, only species and attributes

### Common H-suffixes ###
* As applicable
* e.g.: -hege, -host, -hopter, -honon, -half, -hel, -hili, -hex, -hars
