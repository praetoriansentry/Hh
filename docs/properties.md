Hh Character Properties
-----------------------

### Name ###
We can suggest H based names, but should be encourage.

The full name of a character will be built like:

*[Role] [Name] of [Race]*

Examples:
* Holdier Hhrothgûl of Heágl
* Hoctor Hu of Hatypus
* Hystic Helemne of Hallaby

### Hh Exposure (Hhp) ###
HhP in Hh is analogous to XP in other RPGs.
It's acquired through battling hreatures.
The amount of Hh that the hreature has determines how much HhP is gained.
We can distribute the HhP proportionally.

### Health ###
The total amount that you have goes up based on the attributes and experience that you have.
It can go down based on hreature attacks, being poisoned, falling in traps etc.
It cannot kill you, but it forces you to flee the battle.
If you lose all of your health, there is also some chance you lose one of your items.

### Gold (Honey) ###
Hreatures spill honey when they die.
Honey can be used to buy items (eventually) from a market (p2p).
Until there are markets, honey's influence will be on certain attributes.

### Distanced Travelled ###<!-- TODO: Fun Name (Hurlongs?) -->
This would be the sum total of distance travelled between check-ins.
This would be able to influence certain attributes.

### Total Battles ###
* Battles by hreature
* Battles by location type

The number (and diversity) of battles that you have can influence several of the attributes.

### Hage (Hortnights) ###
Some of the attributes can stabilize with age.
Hage is often times the divisor of many of our formulas
Cunning/Valor seem like things that could be positively influenced by age.
