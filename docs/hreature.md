Hreatures
---------

### Story ###
The hreatures of Hhaerth are going to be common animals that been horribly mutated by Hh over expsoure.

### Hrones ###
When a hreature is de-Hh'd, you more or less take its soul.
At that point, the hreature becomes a drone.
Battling hrones is advantageous because they can drop items and honey but they do not give you Hh.
If a hrone is not battled for some period of time they will wander off to the edge of the world.
